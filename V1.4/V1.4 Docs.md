# WinSimple V1.4

## About Winsimple

#### Winsimple is an abstraction layer to win32 functions and api. It places all of the terribly messy and out-of-date api under the hood so that you can get usefulness from winapi while not being forced to have extensive knowledge in it.    

## Linking WinSimple

### Since Winsimple is a winapi based graphics library, you must link the following windows libraries. 

**```-lgdi32 -luser32 -lole32 -lmsimg32 -lkernel32 -lwinmm -lcomctl32 -lgdiplus```**

### Now you can test your setup using this program.
```
#include "winsimple.h"


int main()
{
        //Create the window
	ws::Window window(960,540,"My WinSimple Window!");
	//Create a Circle
        ws::Radial circle;
        //Set the fill color
	circle.setFillColor(Gdiplus::Color(255,100,200,100));
        //Set the position
	circle.setPosition(960/2,540/2);
        //Set the radius
	circle.setRadius(200);

        //Start the game loop and run window.isOpen() to keep it open.
	while(window.isOpen())
	{
                //Clear the canvas
	        window.clear();
                //Draw the circle to the canvas.
		window.draw(circle);
                //Display the canvas
		window.display();
	}
	return 0;
}
```

## Practices

- Since WinSimple has a few members of same name as Win32 members, it is best practice and likely necessary that you explicitely use the "ws" namespace when accessing it's members.
  


# Structures

## Window

### Constructor Parameters:

##### int width,
- Sets the initial width
##### int height,
- Sets the initial height
##### std::string title,
- Sets the initial title 
##### DWORD style = WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
- Sets the initial window style. Default is WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW. Constructor always includes WS_CLIPCHILDREN.
##### DWORD exStyle = 0)
- Sets the initial extended window style. Default is 0(none). Constructor always includes WS_EX_COMPOSITED. 
### Public Members:
##### HWND hwnd
- The win32 handle to the window. You can use this to modify the window through winapi.
##### int x, y, width, height
- The position of the window and it's size.
##### ws::View view
- An instance of the class ws::View which is used to define where something is drawn to window based on where the camera is pointing.
##### ws::Texture backBuffer
- The canvas texture that ws::Window draws everything to before drawing the canvas on the window.
##### Gdiplus::Graphics* canvas
- The GDI+ object that handles draw operations to the backBuffer texture.
##### ws::Clipboard clipboard
- The clipboard api provided with every ws::Window. The clipboard api offers copying data **to** and **from** the window into Microsoft Windows clipboard.
##### void setView(ws::View &v)
- Sets the view that the window uses. 



### About DWORD styles

#### DWORD's are useful in controlling the styles of the winsimple window. I suggest you take a look at the microsoft documentation for window Styles here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-styles
#### You should also looks at the docs for extended styles.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/extended-window-styles
