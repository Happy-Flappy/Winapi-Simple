V1.0

Created ws::Texture class.

V1.1

Split shape and sprite functionality into ws::Sprite and ws::Shape.
Both classes inherit from ws::Drawable and can both be drawn using window.draw(ws::Drawable &draw).


Fixed Sprite scaling
Fixed Sprite Origin
Fixed Sprite setTextureRect()

Added View class and changed related API.

V1.2

Added Global Input System 
- ws::Global::getMousePos(ws::Window &window)
- ws::Global::getMousePos()
- ws::Global::getKey(char vmKey)
- ws::Global::getMouseButton(char vmButton)


Added Window Transparency
Added ws::View::toWorld()
Added ws::View::toWindow()
Added setLayerAfter() for Z positioning of window.
Added ws::Line class and bool ws::Line::intersects(ws::Line &otherLine).
Added ws::Timer class.



V1.3

Added ws::Poly class that makes a polygon.
Fixed bug where a transparent window flips in one of the graphical copy operations.
Added Sound Class 
Added "Radial" polygonal class.
Added PixelArray class
Added setPixel and getPixel functions to ws::Texture





V1.4 - Beta

Added Button class.
Removed redundant display code in window.update() function.
Added Slider class
Added Textbox class
Added Label class
Added conversion constructors to and from ws::Vec2i and POINT.
Added RGBA class and modified window class to use it for transparency.
Modified window class to use ws::Texture instead of lower level winapi.
Modified ws::Texture to use DIB section instead of basic GDI. Better for transparency and pixel access.
*GRAPHICS IS BROKEN*

*Abandoned Project*

Fallback to V1.3

Re-added  Button,Slider,Textbox,Label classes.
Added complete conversion constructors for ws::Vec2i,ws::Vec2f,ws::Vec2d,ws::Vec3i,ws::Vec3f,ws::Vec3d,ws::IntRect,ws::FloatRect,and ws:DoubleRect.






V1.4 - Plans

To be added:

Camera.h perspective projection class in place of view class. - in progress
Texture stretching into polygonal shapes. - in progress
Mesh3D - in progress
Transformation functions(rotate,scale,color functions,etc.) in PixelArray class.
